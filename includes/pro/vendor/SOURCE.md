Network/UI initialization and output are adapted in ../worker.js; the battle engine and rankers here are unchanged. Rankings and gamemaster data are pinned to the same commit.

The active multi-moveset ranking adapter uses the unchanged combat engine and GameMaster filtering, plus Pokemon.calculateConsistency. Rectangular category and overall scoring live in ../core.js and ../worker.js; the original square-population Ranker and RankerOverall files remain reference sources. See ../README.md for deliberate scoring differences.
